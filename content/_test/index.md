noncredible defense and the militarist sentiments it represents has existed and sprouted since the 2020 pandemic, when everyone was locked inside and internet culture became prolific

ncd sentiments in many ways rised in tandem with the mainstream acceptance of anime, and the rise in the "tactical moe" trope also during the very-late-2010s to 2020s

these ncd sentiments can be described as hypermilitarism, but in a way that runs progressive and explicitly anti-conservative, seeing progress in military warfighting and defense as a progressive endeavour. this mindset is in sharp contrast to traditionally conservative mindsets on military topics, which either prioritizes form or cost over function and utility. in the realm of "form," ncd runs in contrast to fascist/naziist military mindsets, which focuses on showmanship and strength over utility; in terms of "cost," ncd heavily criticizes the conservitive mindset held by so-called "reformers" that subscribe to using established technologies for warfighting rather than researching new weapons to maintain, what the U.S. Army could it describe as, a "Force Overmatch."

this ncd sentiment priortizes utility to accomplish military victory through any means necessary, in disregard to culture, stigma, or fashion -- most notably this mindset is coopted by lgbt and minority cultural viewpoints. what conservatives may call to be "wokeness" in the military, those with this ncd sentiment could assert that intangible cultural norms or stigmas have no bearing on practical military effectiveness or utility.

both ncd and its militarist sentiments have exploded in popularity after russia's 2022 invasion of ukraine, and the many criticisms levied against russia's handling of that invasion by the r/noncredibledefense community.
