The Glossy Gyaru has some cool textures and markings that I couldn’t really talk about in the Glossy Gyaru in the Midterm Insurgency article.
I was on the verge of detailing the Glossy Gyaru’s unit placement (which corresponds with its markings), but it felt too tangential that I eventually cut it from the main article. Additionally, I wanna maintain an objective, third-person narrative tone when I write mainline posts, so even if I did keep it in, I wouldn’t be able to geek out in-depth about the context, unlike my commentary in these DevLogs. I still want to make a dedicated post about Federation unit markings at some point. But for now, I just want to give a rundown on the Glossy Gyaru, her markings, and a little on why Federation unit compositions are so Brigade-centric.
 First off— Glossy Gyaru herself. I say “her” as a sort of loving anthropomorphizing, like how ships are referred with female pronouns. Also, as of writing, I’m not sure if Glossy Gyaru would have a tankgirl incarnation or not (I’ve been considering if this catgirl character should be the tankgirl of the Glossy Gyaru). So, consider my referral to the tank as a female as a form of future proofing.
