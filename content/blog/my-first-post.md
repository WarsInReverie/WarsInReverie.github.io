# Welcome!

Hi, welcome to these *Wars in Reverie*.

This website is still a **work in progress**.  It was first deployed via Github Pages on June 21st, 2025. Ideally, this site will be refined over years, and content will slowly be added as time goes on.

# What to look out for?

There's already some content planned to be published soon. I am still learning Hugo (the website builder used to create this website) in order to present my ideas and stories in the best format on this site.

You can find the rest of my stuff on other platforms, most of which are related to *Wars in Reverie*.

**Please beware:** Before the June 21st, this project was previously under the *"Project Fractures"* or *"Project Amikiro"* nomenclature.

Stay tuned for more, I guess.
