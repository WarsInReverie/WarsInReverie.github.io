It's just been a week since I first made the Glossy Gyaru post — I think 6 days sicne I've actually published the post as well. In that time I've shared it with friends and got some feedback from them, many of which I found interesting enough to document in this devlog. Perhaps I'll be spilling too much tea, but I'm also going to divulge more about what the *Midterm Insurgency* is, in a writer's point-of-view. Perhaps that'll be more of a spoiler, but it's your fault for reading these things where I spill my heart out on how *Wars in Reverie* was created.

# Feedback & Objectives in Writing

So, first to ouch on is the feedback itself. I shared the Glossy Gyaru post to a groupchat of friends (refugees from the Blocksworld fandom that hangout on a Discord server I run), and recieved various sorts of feedback. None were particularly *negative*, but alot of different takes on what I've written.

In particular, alot of those guys reacted to a specific paragraph:

Many of the guys were repulsed with the mention of "Furry peopels" and "Negro peoples", as well as the mention of white-supremecists. No, it isn't because those Blocksworld guys were softie snowflakes or anything (by god, no, half of them are BWMC war criminals). Rather, they were offput by the mere mention of racial tensions. Most of these guys are either North American, and mentions of racial struggle is a political taboo here. I'd wager it's because of our weird history, with the United States in particular being both multi-cultural and having a long spat with suppressing cultures other than white folk. So trying to rangle with racial relations tends to open old wounds, and spark very *very* **very** swamped political debate that many would rather avoid. Not to mention, mentions of racial tensions tend to originate from a certain side of the political spectum (usually lefties and liberlas). So, many of the friends that read the initial *Glossy Gyaru* draft were likely repulsed with this underlying cultural context.

Though some of the guys merely made an unsettled reaction, others did speak up with actual takes. A friend of mine in there, who I'll call *Grape Surgeon* in this devlog, gave this criticism:
"Do what you will with your setting but it feels really on the nose"

We later went into a really in-depth conversation about the writing, the intent I had behind it, and the many things I left omitted. So, the comment above was his initial reaction to the article. His comment really struck me, as it felt like he
