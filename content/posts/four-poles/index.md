Out of the many nations that span the globe of Reverie, there's four that tower above the rest. These *Four Poles* — the superpowers and the nations that follow them — each attempt to expand their spheres of influence, and each with their various goals.

In this four-way rivalry known as the *Great Standoff*, these Poles seldom desire for direct confrontation — Any direct fighting against another superpower would be unimaginatively detrimental to their own strength and economy. Instead, these Poles use various other means to gain an edge: economic coersion, political intrigue, and clandestine operations. All of these factors comprise the various proxy conflicts fought to exert each Poles' influence amongst weaker nations. 

All to unravel this grand game of four-player Chess, with the world as their chessboard.


## The Dynasty

The Eight-Spear Empire, more commonly known as "The Dynasty," is a union of eight kingdoms making up the imperial court, united under one throne. 



<!-- The Dynasty was made atop a tangled mess of politics, and this succession crisis may very well unravel this great nation at the seams. -->


## The Collective

The Collective, living up to its name, is made up of a collective of many socialist parties under one nation. However, it's internal politics is wholely dominated by just three: The Anarchists, the Militocracy, and the Democratic Socialists.



<!-- The **Anarchist Socialists** were the principal force that overthrew the tyrannical regime that predated the Collective. This party, scared by the governance of the previous regime, fully believes that governance should be consented to, and that any government that imposes itself upon the citizenry is tyrannical — and this could very well apply to the bureaucracy of the Collective. The sole reason the Anarchists haven't attempted to overthrow the Collective too is the agreements made in the "First Cartel" — The Anarchists will help maintain the Collectivist government, if said government supplies the Anarchists with arms to spread the global revolution. With that agreement, the Anarchists now focus their attention abroad, to overthrow foreign governments and liberate the world from the clutches of tyranny. 

The **Militocratic Socialists** — made up principally of military officials, veterans, or jingoist politicians — belive in making the Collective more into an autocracy. Although demonized by both the Democratic and Anarchist socialists, their beliefs are not without cause: The Collective, although a superpower, stands as the solely "true" socialist nation in a sea of capitalist nations. It is constantly under threat by other superpowers, and is surrounded by increasingly hostile neighbors. These military officers fully believe that the Collective must to maintain a centralized military and well-planned industry to properly defend itself against capitalist incursions; Sending their arms elsewhere with the Anarchists, or demilitarizing for the Democratic Socialsits, both put the sole beacon of socialism at risk.

Finally, there's the **Democratic Socialists**, comprised mostly by the educated citizenry. Criticized by the other two parties for being naïve to the realities of socialism, the Democratic Socialists strongly support universal rights, pro-democratic values, and government-run social programs to provide a social safety net to all citizens. Although many of these goals have been achieved after the sweeping democratic reforms of the late-20th century, other goals such as isolationist foreign affairs and demilitarization the central government are continually rejected by the Anarchists and Militocrats respectively. The Democratic Socialists have been decried by Socialist-purists for being too "comfortable" with the status-quo in Collectivist society, abandoning the mission ofglobal socialism — a critique that both the Anarchsits and Militocrats frequently levy. -->


## The Federation

The Unified Aezelian Federation, colloqually just called "The Federation," is a federated republic of many constituent governments. These constituencies, ranging from "states" to "republics" to native "nations," govern their own regions and maintain their own sets of laws and government agencies.

Because of The Federation possesses an immensely diverse culture and society, especially when compared to its peer Poles. Indeed, the Federation — officially — prides itself with how populations of 


The Federation, and most of its current citizenry, holds a heritage not native to Aezelia itself. The nation is made of principally of immigrants — whether it was the initial colonists a millenia past immediately after the *Age of Darkness*, or more recent the immigrants fleeing the various *Standoff Wars* abroad.


## The Regime

Branded by outsiders simply as "The Regime," this autocratic nation strives to put universal human rights before all else. Unfortunately, there's alot of other sentient species that qualifies as "all else."



<!-- The Regime is less of a nation, and more a rabid animal — always prowling for its next target to prey upon. The reigning dictatorship is sure to keep this animal well-fed and on a tight leesh, but the question of "if this animal breaks free" remains unanswered. Today, the Regime's population is content with scape-goating magical and furry peoples, but when the true economic reality sets in, how well can this easily agitated nation handle a smite to its internal stability? Although this nation can effortlessly prey on its neighbors and play onto the world's fears, it is equally capable of consuming itself in its own feral hellfire. -->
