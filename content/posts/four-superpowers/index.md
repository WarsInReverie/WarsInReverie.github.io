Out of the many nations that span the globe of Reverie, there's four that tower above the rest. These *Four Poles* — the superpowers and the nations that follow them — each attempt to expand their spheres of influence, and each for their own various goals. 

In the age of the *Standoff*, these Poles seldom desire for direct confrontation with one-another — Any sort of direct fighting against another superpower would be extraordinary detrimental to their own economy and sphere of influence. Regardless, these Poles use various other means to gain an edge over each other. Various economic influences, political intrigue, and clandestine operations, all culminating to the *Standoff Wars*, the various proxy wars fought to exert each Poles' hard power amongst weaker nations. 

All to unravel this grand game of four-player Chess, with the world as their chessboard.

## The Dynasty

The Eight-Spear Empire, more commonly known as "The Dynasty," is a union of eight kingdoms making up the imperial court, united under one throne. It is named such because of its ruling family, a dynastic bloodline rich in regional history that allegedly traces back to the an original *Saint of Light* a thousand years past. More recently, it was this royal bloodline that united the region's eight kingdoms to serve under one throne — with some compromises, of course.

Such compromises can be seen by the peculiar make-up of Dynastic society. Day-to-day life is an odd mix of an industrialized capitalist society and a pre-industrial neofeudal system. It's governance is equally odd, possessing an emperor with eight soverign kings making up their court, and a pseudo-constitutional parliment of elected officials to serve the empire at large. The court gets even more complicated when considering the autonomously operated conscript military, and each of the kingdoms' royal houses and their accompanying arms. All of these are the result of hold-overs, compromises, and haphazard agreements made between the Dynasty's transition from the pre-industrial age to the modern age.

And all of these compromises cause countless sources of friction within the Dynastic court. The presence of a constitution and the imperial parliament constantly pulls against the royal court, and the jurisdictions between the two remains unclear. And though united under one thrown, each of the Eight kingdoms are still considered soverign, and still fight over local disputes if left unresolved by the court at large. Each of these kingdoms are governed by a royal house, which maintains it's own cadré of warriors, seperate from the conscripted Imperial Armed Forces. Such an imperial military is not accountable by the civilian parliament, commonly runs amok with its own objectives ad goals, and frequently butts heads with the eight kingdoms and their warrior castes.



The Dynasty's imperial court is a tangled mess of politics, barely held together by gentlemen's agreements and tacit decorum.

## The Collective

The Collective, living up to its name, is made up of a collective of many socialist parties under one nation. However, it's internal politics is wholely dominated by just three: The Anarchists, the Militocracy, and the Democratic Socialists.

The **Anarchist Socialists** were the principal force that overthrew the tyrannical regime that predated the Collective. This party, scared by the governance of the previous regime, fully believes that governance should be consented to, and that any government that imposes itself upon the citizenry is tyrannical — and this could very well apply to the bureaucracy of the Collective. The sole reason the Anarchists haven't attempted to overthrow the Collective too is the agreements made in the "First Cartel" — The Anarchists will help maintain the Collectivist government, if said government supplies the Anarchists with arms to spread the global revolution. With that agreement, the Anarchists now focus their attention abroad, to overthrow foreign governments and liberate the world from the clutches of tyranny. 

The **Militocratic Socialists** — made up principally of military officials, veterans, and other miliophiles — belive in making the Collective more into an autocracy. Although demonized by both the Democratic and Anarchist socialists, their beliefs are not without cause: The Collective, although a superpower, stands as the solely "true" socialist nation in a sea of capitalist nations. It is constantly under threat by other superpowers, and is surrounded by increasingly hostile neighbors. These military officers fully believe that the Collective must to maintain a centralized military and well-planned industry to properly defend itself against capitalist incursions; Sending their arms elsewhere with the Anarchists, or demilitarizing for the Democratic Socialsits, both put the sole beacon of socialism at risk.

Finally, there's the **Democratic Socialists**, comprised mostly by the educated citizenry. Criticized by the other two parties for being naïve to the realities of socialism, the Democratic Socialists champion universal rights, maintaining democratic reforms, and government-run social programs to provide a social safety net to all citizens.

## The Federation

The Unified Aezelian Federation, colloqually just called "The Federation," is a federated republic of many constituent governments. These constituencies, ranging from "states" to "republics" to native "nations," govern their own regions and maintain their own sets of laws and government agencies.

The Federation, and most of its current citizenry, are not native to Aezelia itself. The nation is made of principally of immigrants — whether it was the initial colonists immediately after the *Age of Darkness*, or more recent the immigrants fleeing the various *Standoff Wars* abroad.

## The Regime

Branded by outsiders simply as "The Regime," this autocratic nation strives to put universal human rights before all else. Unfortunately, there's alot of other sentient species that qualifies as "all else."

The Regime is quite conservative in terms of its culture, governance, and societal outlook on the world. It commonly decries any concept of "magic," and
