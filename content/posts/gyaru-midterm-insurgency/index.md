Among the countless Federation service members that saw action in the Midterm Insurgency, one of the most photogenic was the crew and infantry escort of one MBT-31 Foxtrotter: the “Glossy Gyaru.”

The Glossy Gyaru was a tank from Company F of the 2nd Armored Battalion, 6th Armored Brigade. When she deployed for the Midterm Insurgency, she was detached to support the infantry of Company G, 3rd Infantry Battalion, 6th Armored. Together with those infantrymen, this tank seen action throughout the Midterm Insurgency.

The Midterm Insurgency was an internal conflict within the Federation between 1974 to 1979. The etymology of the name is two-fold: Firstly, the conflict coincided with the Midterm Elections of 1974, and was largely resolved by the Midterm Elections of 1978, hence the conflict’s association with the Midterms. Secondly, though some people consider this to be the Federation’s “second civil war," the Federation government had not declared a state of war during the conflict. Instead, government statements describe the period as an insurgency, thus how the conflict recieved its historical nomenclature.

Although the term “insurgency” sounds singular, the conflict was characterized by massive internal strife across the Federation. There was a motley of belligerents, ranging from pro-democracy protesters to anti-furry mobs, to anarcho-syndicalist freedom fighters, to rebellious local governments, to a motley of other rival groups. Each of these groups have vastly different objectives and circumstances, but all were in defiance to the Federation government.

To summarize in broad terms: the Midterm Insurgency started in 1974 due to racial tensions between human supremecist citizens and various minorities in the Federation, ethnic and otherwise. This tension was inflamed by the 1974 Midterm elections, which introduced a wave of new officials that backed anti-segregationist reforms. These reforms, in turn, angered hardline conservatives and ultra-nationalists. Political provocateurs began to riot across the Federation in denial of the elections, and violently targetted minority groups such as Furry people, Negro people, Socialist groups, immigrant communities, and others. This, in turn, prompted other groups (namely Socialist-aligned groups) to arm themselves, deeming the Federation government as inadequate for their protection. With various political groups becoming openly rebellious, the Federation military was called upon to stamp out these sources of dissent, through all means enabled by the newly elected delegation.

By the time of the Midterm Insurgency, the “Glossy Gyaru” should have been stricken from the Federation Army inventory. She was an unmodified MBT-31 Foxtrotter, built during the design’s original production run in the late-1960’s. By the mid-1970’s, the Glossy Gyaru and tanks of similar age should have been considered obsolete. However, the start of the Midterm Insurgency meant that the Federation Army couldn’t wait for desperately needed weapons and materiel. Thus, the Glossy Gyaru’s retirement was postponed, and the tank was immediately pushed into deployment with the 6th Armored.

As part of the 6th Armored, the Glossy Gyaru seen action throughout the Federation heartlands, suppressing forces hostile to Federation law. Most of these missions were policing actions: Tanks patrolling cities as a “show-of-force" to deter violence. A few others, however, were combat missions. In combat, military tanks supported soldiers and policemen by providing cover with their heavy armor, or in some rare instances, providing fire support with their cannons. The Glossy Gyaru was photographed in many of those engagements, providing direct fires against entrenched rebels in rural lands.

Though tanks can be considered as overkill in a counter-insurgency campaign, they represent the how hellbent the Federation government was willing to assert its authority and morals, even if it was in conflict of local or cultural norms.

Ever since the conflict ended in 1979, these pictures of the Glossy Gyaru have been enshrined in Federation history. The tank itself became known as a plucky mascot of the Midterm Insurgency — a bold crew and the soldiers that accompanied them fighting for a seemingly virtuous cause. The photos themselves, however, gave off a more bleak connotation: Images of a main battle tank — a mechanical chariot meant to crush soldiers of foreign armies — rolling through Federation streets, as if enacting invasion against its own citizenry. These photos serve as a reminder that the Federation's cherished values of multiculturalism were not borne out of willingness to include and accept; It was won, enforced, and maintained through consecutive violence. This is no less demonstrated than by a proud tank of a diverse crew, traversing the nation to deliver direct ordinance against all those that dissent; The tank that was emblazoned the *Glossy Gyaru*.
