# Welcome!

Hi, welcome to my *Wars in Reverie*.

This website is still a **work in progress**. 

This website was first brought online via Github Pages on June 21st, 2025. The site will be refined over years, and content will slowly trickle in as time goes on.

# What to look out for?

There's already some content planned to be published soon. I am still learning Hugo (the website builder used to create this website) in order to present my ideas and stories in the best format on this site.

You can find the rest of my stuff on other platforms, most of which are related to *Wars in Reverie*.

Note that before this website's publishing (21st June), this project was previously under the "*Project Amikiro*" nomenclature.

Stay tuned for more, I guess.
